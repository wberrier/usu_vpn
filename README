Script to configure the USU vpn for a linux machine.

This is tested and works on Ubuntu 10.10 as long as an updated openswan
is installed (2.6.31 or later) that enables ALLOW_MICROSOFT_BAD_PROPOSAL.

You can get one from:

http://www.openswan.org/download/binaries/ubuntu/

*NOTE* This script totally blows away the configuration for ppp,
xl2tpd, and ipsec and replaces it with the necessary usu settings.  It
also stores your credentials on the disk.

It may work on other distros, I'm not sure.

It's based on the setup that an ex USU sysadmin had posted (which may work
with an updated openswan, but I haven't tried that)

as well as on the info posted at:

http://www.jacco2.dds.nl/networking/linux-l2tp.html

This version doesn't make the vpn the default route, but only sets up the
route necessary to connect to the usu subnet.

This script doesn't use specific dns entries, since it appears that
the public dns records worked fine.
